Earlier this week the sportswear giant announced they will be extending their contract with the NFL through 2038. On this week’s episode of Yahoo Finance Sports Report, host Joe Pompliano breaks down the significance of this NFL partnership and why it’s a win for Nike, especially with the new CEO Elliott Hill — who entered the role in October 2024 — at the helm of this deal. “[Hill] has only been on the job for a few months now, but he specifically said he wanted athletes to be at the center of everything they do,” Pompliano says. “That includes sports and sports leagues like the NFL. So this is a great sign for Nike.” Pompliano is also joined by combat sports journalist and host of The Ariel Helwani Show, Ariel Helwani, to discuss the world of MMA (mixed martial arts), especially the growth of UFC. Helwani attributes a lot of it to the UFC\'s media rights deal with ESPN that began in 2019. UFC is currently owned by TKO Group Holdings (TKO), with Dana White continuing to lead the combat sports promoter as CEO and president. “When ESPN is in business with an entity, they start to cover them and promote them a lot more. So they\'ll be on the ticker, they\'ll be on dot com, all that stuff, and more,” Helwani says. “When they really want to put the muscle and the machine behind it, it changes in a massive way.” Yahoo Finance Sports Report with Joe Pompliano, a vodcast brought to you by Yahoo Finance and Yahoo Sports, looks beyond the latest sports business headlines, analyzes all the need-to-know news — the teams, trades, and billion dollar deals — so you and your portfolio will win BIG.

Yahoo Finance Video • 14 hours ago   NKE   +0.26%       Nike stock pops on earnings beat Nike (NKE) reported fiscal 2025 second quarter results that topped analyst estimates on both the top and bottom lines, sending shares soaring in after-hours trading. The sports apparel company reported earnings of $0.78 per share, well above the Bloomberg consensus estimate of $0.63. Revenue was $12.35 billion compared to an estimate of $12.13 billion, though it was a year-over-year decline. This was the first quarterly report under new CEO Elliott Hill, who said in the release that Nike is "taking immediate action to reposition our business, so we can get back to driving long-term shareholder value."

The automaker\'s stock is up more than 40% in a year in which rivals Ford (F) and Stellantis (STLA) saw their share prices fall by double-digit percentages. GM CEO Mary Barra credits the company\'s portfolio of vehicles, telling Yahoo Finance Executive Editor Brian Sozzi, "We have the strongest internal combustion engine portfolio we\'ve had in a long time. And this, for General Motors, was the year of EVs. The portfolio of EVs that we have that cover the different segments, from luxury to value, really has given consumers choice between ICE and EV and I think that\'s what\'s fueling our profitability." Looking ahead, Barra wants to work on scaling the EV business because "scale is going to be so important to drive to profitability." She also acknowledged that "difficult decisions" were made in order to set GM up for success, including exiting the robotaxi business and absorbing the Cruise unit into the division developing fully autonomous personal vehicles. On GM\'s plan to make only electric vehicles by 2035, Barra says it will ultimately be up to what the consumer wants. "We\'re going to be guided by the consumer. We want to give the consumer choice. What do they want to drive? We don\'t want to get into a situation where regulations are driving us to force something into the market that\'s not what they want."

Amid a tighter control on costs and new product introductions, Robinhood (HOOD) has become a profitable business with its eyes set on taking on legacy financial platforms. The stock has surged this year as the business has pivoted to growth mode. Hence, the company has won Yahoo Finance’s ‘Comeback of the Year’ award. Yahoo Finance Executive Editor Brian Sozzi talks with Mizuho senior analyst Dan Dolev about the future of the stock trading platform Robinhood. The company is becoming more than just a place to buy and sell stocks; think more of a wealth management player — and perhaps sports betting. Dolev is a bull on the stock and makes a compelling case for more upside after a big run-up this year.
