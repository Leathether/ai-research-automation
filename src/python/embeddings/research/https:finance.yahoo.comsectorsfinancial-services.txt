The trading platform\'s shares have surged over 190% as the company achieved profitability and expanded its product offerings. Piper Sandler Companies senior research analyst Patrick Moley joins Market Domination to analyze Robinhood\'s growth trajectory. "The most exciting part of this growth story is ahead of us," Moley states, highlighting the company\'s success in attracting customers and enhancing its product lineup. He points to Robinhood\'s new web-based trading platform, which opens access to 50% of the retail market that "they never really had access to before," positioning the company for continued expansion in 2025. Moley notes that 75% of Robinhood\'s customer base consists of millennials or younger users, making products like cryptocurrency and mobile trading particularly appealing because "the customers are much more open to trying new products if introduced on the platform." "One in 10 Americans have a Robinhood account, yet they only have a quarter percent of ... the total retail assets in the United States," he explains, adding, "It\'s a very small market share, but they have a very strong brand and we expect them to grow their assets under custody and grow earnings significantly in the coming year."

Here\'s why.   Yahoo Finance • 22 hours ago   AMC   +0.99%   GME   +1.58%   HOOD   -0.38%        Robinhood is the perfect Trump stock: Analyst Robinhood has come a long way financially since it burst onto the scene during the meme stock frenzy. Amid a tighter control on costs and new product introductions, Robinhood (HOOD) has become a profitable business with its eyes set on taking on legacy financial platforms. The stock has surged this year as the business has pivoted to growth mode. Hence, the company has won Yahoo Finance’s ‘Comeback of the Year’ award. Yahoo Finance Executive Editor Brian Sozzi talks with Mizuho senior analyst Dan Dolev about the future of the stock trading platform Robinhood. The company is becoming more than just a place to buy and sell stocks; think more of a wealth management player — and perhaps sports betting. Dolev is a bull on the stock and makes a compelling case for more upside after a big run-up this year.
