Darden Restaurants is the largest restaurant operator in the US full-service space, with consolidated revenue of $11.4 billion in fiscal 2024 resulting in 3%-4% full-service market share (per NRA data and our calculations). The company maintains a portfolio of 10 restaurant brands: Olive Garden, LongHorn Steakhouse, Cheddar’s Scratch Kitchen, Ruth\'s Chris, Yard House, The Capital Grille, Seasons 52, Eddie V’s, Bahama Breeze, and The Capital Burger. Darden generates revenue almost exclusively from company-owned restaurants, though a small network of franchised restaurants and consumer-packaged goods sales through the traditional grocery channel contribute modestly.

Bernstein senior analyst Aneesha Sherman joins Market Domination Overtime to evaluate Nike\'s growth prospects. Sherman describes it as "a good quarter" for the sportswear brand, though "unexpected." She highlights that the most promising signal came from the press release\'s messaging about "taking immediate action, returning to sport, returning to our roots, being Nike again." She notes that historically, whenever Nike experiences a down year, it refocuses on its sporting foundation, "which has sort of been lost in the last few years" amid its innovation efforts. Sherman emphasizes that the new CEO, Elliott Hill should prioritize the company\'s distribution strategy to make a meaningful impact. "Elliott Hill\'s background is perfect for this," she explains. With Hill\'s 30-year tenure at Nike, he is "intimately familiar with the channels," making him "the perfect person to lead this return back to distribution."

Yahoo Finance Video • 14 hours ago   NKE   +0.26%       GM stock surged in 2024. CEO Mary Barra says this is why. General Motors (GM) was named Yahoo Finance\'s 2024 Surprise of the Year. The automaker\'s stock is up more than 40% in a year in which rivals Ford (F) and Stellantis (STLA) saw their share prices fall by double-digit percentages. GM CEO Mary Barra credits the company\'s portfolio of vehicles, telling Yahoo Finance Executive Editor Brian Sozzi, "We have the strongest internal combustion engine portfolio we\'ve had in a long time. And this, for General Motors, was the year of EVs. The portfolio of EVs that we have that cover the different segments, from luxury to value, really has given consumers choice between ICE and EV and I think that\'s what\'s fueling our profitability." Looking ahead, Barra wants to work on scaling the EV business because "scale is going to be so important to drive to profitability." She also acknowledged that "difficult decisions" were made in order to set GM up for success, including exiting the robotaxi business and absorbing the Cruise unit into the division developing fully autonomous personal vehicles. On GM\'s plan to make only electric vehicles by 2035, Barra says it will ultimately be up to what the consumer wants. "We\'re going to be guided by the consumer. We want to give the consumer choice. What do they want to drive? We don\'t want to get into a situation where regulations are driving us to force something into the market that\'s not what they want."

What kind of impacts could this have on mortgage rates and the US housing market? Fannie Mae (Federal National Mortgage Association) chief economist Mark Palim sits down with Josh Lipton talk about more about pricing trends in the housing market. Fannie Mae\'s affiliate organization, the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (or Freddie Mac), is scheduled to release the latest mortgage rate figures Thursday morning. "The key issue for the housing market in the United States, for sure, has been affordability, of which high mortgage rates [are] definitely part of that discussion and it\'s also being renter affordability," Palim says. "The Fed today came out and ratified... bond market investor concerns about whether inflation would be as stickier than it looked six months ago, or that they even looked at the beginning of the year. So you should expect mortgage rates to... remain a little higher than they might have otherwise been." Palim describes mortgage rates, a key component for the lock-in effect for homeowners, as being in a "tug-of-war" with housing affordability: "People don\'t want to move and give up that 3% mortgage rate and affordability. We started the year with existing home sales running at 4.2 million; we\'re ending the year running... around 4 million. So you\'re seeing the higher rates relative to where they were a few years ago really starting to affect demand."
