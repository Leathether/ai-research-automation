In its fiscal 2024, which ended in May, FedEx derived 47% of revenue from its express division, 37% from ground, and 10% from freight, its asset-based less-than-truckload shipping segment. The remainder came from other services, including FedEx Office, which provides document production/shipping, and FedEx Logistics, which provides global forwarding. FedEx acquired Dutch parcel delivery firm TNT Express in 2016, boosting its presence across Europe. TNT was previously the fourth-largest global parcel delivery provider.

Third Bridge Group Global head of analysts Peter McNally joins Market Domination Overtime to analyze FedEx\'s (FDX) fiscal second quarter earnings and its announcement to split into two business units. The parcel carrier and logistics operator aims to spin off its FedEx Freight segment. "FedEx hasn\'t sat still for a long time," McNally says, noting that while the split was expected, challenges lie ahead. He highlights FedEx Freight\'s strong performance within its segment but points to the company\'s second guidance cut in three months. Despite solid business operations, he cites headwinds including competition and a weak industrial environment "that is dragging results." McNally questions "how much more costs can be driven out of this business." He observes that the "easy" cost-cutting measures have "pretty much been done," adding that clarity on how the separated businesses can achieve further cost reductions remains uncertain.

Its FedEx Freight unit also came below revenue forecasts by posting $2.18 billion ($2.36 billion was expected).

FedEx Freight, the largest U.S. provider of less-than-truckload (LTL) services, could be valued between $30 billion and $35 billion, as per an estimate from Citi.  Analysts have long argued that Freight was undervalued within FedEx, which has been slashing expenses and consolidating its express and ground operations in recent quarters.
