Latest News View More       US equity funds saw biggest net outflows in 15 years ahead of Fed decision Investors pulled a net $50.2 billion from U.S. equity funds in the week ending Dec. 18, according to LSEG Lipper data, the biggest net outflow since Sept. as they cashed in profits from a market rally ahead of the Fed policy decision. The Fed cut rates as expected on Wednesday but projected fewer-than-expected interest rate cuts and higher inflation next year, while Chair Jerome Powell explicitly referred a need for caution, prompting a sell-off in equity markets.

As 2025 approaches, investors are focusing on the Fed\'s view of the neutral interest rate in the post-pandemic economy. The Wall Street Journal\'s Chief Economics Correspondent, Nick Timiraos, joins Market Domination to explore the concept of the Fed\'s neutral rate. Timiraos explains that a decade ago, the Fed rarely discussed neutral rate outlooks publicly. This changed during Fed Chair Janet Yellen\'s term, when she began discussing how rates would remain lower for longer due to a declining neutral rate. Timiraos defines the neutral rate as "what the right interest rate would be to ... have low and stable inflation with maximum employment. What is the interest rate that best gets you there and keeps you there when there aren\'t shocks hitting the economy," though he describes this as "a nirvana-like scenario." This neutral rate helps the Fed determine whether they should be "stepping on the gas pedal or stepping on the breaks" regarding monetary policy. However, Timiraos notes that the upcoming Trump administration\'s policies are "adding more uncertainty to this" current calculation.

The picture painted by the Fed removes monetary easing as tailwind from the stock market for months and has seen the dollar rocket to its highest in more than two years - bowling over emerging, developed and crypto currencies alike.  Lifting their median inflation forecast for next year by 0.3 percentage point to 2.5% but only nudging the GDP growth up a tenth to 2.1%, Fed policymakers also raised their policy rate forecasts for the next two years by half a point to 3.9% and 3.4% respectively.

U.S. stocks looked set to pare back some of their losses on Thursday after Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell put a lump of coal in markets’ Christmas stocking by signaling that sticky inflation means investors shouldn’t expect deep rate cuts next year.  Futures tracking the Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 321 points, or 0.8%.  All three indexes had plummeted on Wednesday, with Powell’s hawkish presser sinking the Dow by 1,100 points to lock in its longest losing streak in half a century.

Despite industry fragmentation, it holds a leading position in the hydraulic fracturing and completions market, which makes up nearly half of its revenue. It also holds strong positions in other service offerings like drilling and completions fluids, which leverages its expertise in material science, as well as the directional drilling market. While we consider SLB the global leader in reservoir evaluation, we think Halliburton leads in any activity from the reservoir to the wellbore.
