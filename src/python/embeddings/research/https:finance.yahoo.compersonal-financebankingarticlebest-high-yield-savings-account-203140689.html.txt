Read our full review of TAB Bank What is a high-yield savings account? A high-yield savings account (HYSA) is a type of deposit account offered by brick-and-mortar banks, online banks, neobanks, and credit unions. As with traditional savings accounts, high-yield savings accounts typically don’t offer debit cards or check-writing privileges; you may be able to transfer money between your HYSA and other accounts via online transfers. An HYSA functions similarly to a traditional savings account, except you can earn much more interest. In some cases, you can get an annual percentage yield (APY) that is 10 times higher than the national average savings account rate. In fact, HYSAs currently offer some of the highest rates available on deposit products, with some financial institutions advertising APYs over 5%.    High-yield savings accounts typically have no minimum opening balance requirements or monthly fees, though some banks may require you to maintain a minimum balance to earn interest or avoid a monthly service charge. Depending on the financial institution, you may earn the same rate regardless of your balance, or your APY may be tiered based on your balance. High-yield savings accounts vs. traditional savings accounts High-yield savings accounts work the same way traditional savings accounts do; the main difference is the interest rate. Savings account interest rates are typically less than 1%, while high-yield savings accounts offer rates as high as 4% and 5%. Fees, restrictions, and minimum deposit requirements depend on the financial institution for both account types, and both types of accounts are FDIC-insured. Read more:  High-yield savings account vs. traditional savings account: Which one is better?  Why open a savings account?   What is APY? A high-yield savings account’s interest rate represents how much you’ll earn in simple interest (interest earned on the principal balance). The annual percentage yield (APY) is the rate of return, including compound interest, which is the interest you earn on the principal balance and accrued interest. Most savings accounts compound interest daily or monthly. The more often interest compounds, the faster your money will grow. HYSAs come with variable interest rates. That means your bank or credit union can change your APY at any time. Generally, APYs increase when the economy is doing well, and the Federal Reserve raises its benchmark rate. Conversely, rates can drop when the economy weakens, and the Fed lowers rates. Read more:  What is annual percentage yield (APY)?  What is a good savings account interest rate?  What is compound interest, and how is it calculated?  Savings interest rates today  Savings accounts that offer 5% APY and up   Pros and cons of high-yield savings accounts There are many benefits of opening a high-yield savings account, particularly the opportunity to earn a competitive rate on your balance. However, there are some drawbacks to consider as well. Let’s take a closer look at the pros and cons of high-yield savings accounts: Pros:  Higher interest rates: You’ll generally earn more interest than you would with a traditional savings account.  Compound interest: Compounding interest helps your balance grow more quickly. Interest in an HYSA may compound daily or monthly.  Accessibility: These accounts are a great place to stash money you may need to access quickly, such as your emergency fund. Other types of accounts, such as certificates of deposit (CDs), offer high rates but impose penalties if you withdraw money prior to the maturity date.  Minimal or no fees: Fees with high-yield savings accounts are rare, so you won’t need to worry about these costs eating into your balance.  Low-risk: High-yield savings accounts are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) and the National Credit Union Administration (NCUA). Plus, unlike investments, account performance isn’t tied to the stock market and you can’t lose money, making HYSAs a low-risk option for your money.   Cons:  Variable rates: Your savings account’s APY can increase or decrease over time. While individual banks set rates at their discretion, these rates are loosely tied to the federal funds rate. Banks may choose to increase or decrease savings rates when the Fed adjusts its target rate.  Minimum balance requirement: Some accounts may have a high minimum opening deposit.  Tiered APYs: Some banks may have tiered APYs depending on the deposit amount. For instance, you may earn a higher rate if you deposit $5,000 vs. $100. So, while a $5,000 deposit isn’t necessarily required, it could result in a better APY.  Better for short-term savings: High-yield savings accounts aren’t the best choice for long-term savings goals, like retirement. Investment accounts tend to offer higher long-term returns.  Withdrawal limits may apply: Depending on your bank, you may have a limit on monthly withdrawals.   Read more: Understanding the pros and cons of high-yield savings accounts Alternatives to high-yield savings accounts An HYSA can be a smart place to store your savings, but it's not your only option. Here's a look at some of the alternatives you may want to consider. Money market accounts Money market accounts and high-yield savings accounts both offer higher interest rates compared to traditional savings accounts. However, these accounts come with different features. For instance, MMAs typically offer check-writing abilities and debit cards, though they might require higher minimum balances to earn the top interest rates. High-yield savings accounts, on the other hand, are designed to store your savings longer-term with fewer withdrawal options. Learn more about money market accounts vs. high-yield savings accounts. Read more: Money market account vs. high-yield savings account: Which is right for you? CDs Like high-yield savings accounts, CDs can provide a safe place to store your savings while earning a competitive return. The big difference is that CDs require you to lock in your money for a set period, known as the term, which can range from a few months to several years. For this reason, CDs are a better option for people who don't need immediate access to their funds. Learn more about high-yield savings accounts vs. CDs. Read more: High-yield savings account vs. CD: Which is right for you? Investing High-yield savings accounts and investing serve vastly different financial goals and risk profiles. HYSAs provide stable, low-risk returns with interest rates higher than traditional savings accounts. They're best for short-term financial goals or emergency funds due to their liquidity and FDIC insurance. Investing in bonds, stocks, mutual funds, and other securities typically involves higher risk — but also the potential for higher returns over the long run. Investing your money makes more sense for long-term financial goals like retirement since the returns generally outpace inflation and help grow wealth over time.

Historical savings rates Today's savings account rates are the highest they've been in more than a decade, making it a great time to put your money in one. Here's a look at how historical savings rates have changed since 2014.   Tips for finding the best high-yield savings account Competitive rates are great, but considering other factors besides APY can help you find an account that best meets your needs. New account offers Look at high-yield savings account offers for new depositors with high APYs, low to no account fees, and are free to open. High savings account rates will earn you more interest, but the financial institution offering those rates might not necessarily be the best option for your finances, so do your research before opening an account. Required deposits Research applicable deposit requirements. Is there a minimum initial deposit requirement? Do any other deposit requirements apply? Are there tiered APYs depending on your deposit amount? Fees Some accounts may have monthly maintenance fees or other fees. Look into which fees may apply before opening a new account. Accessibility Understand how you can access your money before opening a new account. For example, can you log into an online dashboard? Does your bank have a mobile app? Is it connected to an ATM network? Deposit options Review available deposit options. Are mobile check deposits via a mobile banking app an option? Can you make direct deposits via an ATM? Account linking Look into whether you can link your new account to an existing checking account at another bank. Make sure there are no restrictions or waiting periods when it comes to accessing your money. Read more: How to choose the right high-yield savings account for you How to open a high-yield savings account Once you’ve determined the best high-yield savings account for you, opening one is simple and can be done in person or online. You’ll generally need to provide your personal information, proof of identity, and address to open a new account. Make sure you have your driver’s license, Social Security number, and copies of a recent mortgage statement or utility bill. Depending on the account, a minimum deposit amount could apply when you open your HYSA account. If that’s the case, you’ll also need to be ready to transfer money from an existing account to meet the deposit requirement. Learn more about opening a high-yield savings account. HYSA frequently asked questions (FAQs) Is your money safe in a HYSA? As long as your account is held by an FDIC- or NCUA-insured institution, your money is federally insured up to the $250,000 limit. How often do HYSA rates change? Savings account rates are subject to change at your bank’s discretion. To get the most recent rate information for the accounts you’re considering, you’ll need to visit those institutions’ websites or call them directly to learn more. Can you withdraw money from a HYSA? Yes, you can withdraw money from a high-yield savings account. However, these accounts may have rules in place regarding the maximum number of withdrawals you can make within a given month or statement period without incurring a fee. What is the highest paying high-yield savings account? Among our list of the 10 best high-yield savings accounts, the highest rate available is 5.05% APY, offered by EverBank. Do you pay taxes on high-yield savings accounts? Yes, the interest earnings from high-yield savings accounts are considered taxable income. You should receive a Form 1099-INT from your bank if you earn more than $10 in interest during the year, which you need to report on your tax return. Are high-yield savings accounts still worth it? High-yield savings accounts are one of the best places to keep extra cash, whether for your emergency fund or short-term savings. The best rates currently hover between 4% and 5% APY. Can savings account interest rates change? Interest rates on savings accounts can change at any time. They're influenced by several factors, including the federal funds rate, general economic conditions, and individual bank policies. What type of bank account gives the most interest? Typically, high-yield savings accounts, CDs, and money market accounts offer higher interest rates compared to standard checking or savings accounts. Can you lose money in a high-yield savings account? In most cases, you won't lose money in a high-yield savings account as long as the financial institution is insured by the FDIC or NCUA, which cover up to $250,000 per depositor, per institution, per ownership category. However, there are certain instances when your HYSA could lose money.
