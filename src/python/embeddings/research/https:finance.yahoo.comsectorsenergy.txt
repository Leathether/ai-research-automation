Despite industry fragmentation, it holds a leading position in the hydraulic fracturing and completions market, which makes up nearly half of its revenue. It also holds strong positions in other service offerings like drilling and completions fluids, which leverages its expertise in material science, as well as the directional drilling market. While we consider SLB the global leader in reservoir evaluation, we think Halliburton leads in any activity from the reservoir to the wellbore. The firm’s innovations have helped multiple producers lower their development costs per barrel of oil equivalent, with techniques that have been homed in over a century of operations.

Rating  Price Target    Morningstar• 10 hours ago  \xa0    Technical Assessment: Bullish in the Intermediate-Term     How dare the market get crushed in December? Every study based on prior price action guaranteed a winning month for the end the year. That still could happen, as the S&P 500 finished November at 6,032 -- so we have time. Maybe this is the much-talked-about mid-December low, also known as "The Only Free Lunch on Wall Street." If it is, it happened with a bang.   The Federal Reserve, as expected, lowered the fed funds rate by 25 basis point to a target range of 4.25%-4.5%. The Fed now projects just two rate cuts in 2025 and noted that the unemployment rate remains low and inflation remains a tad elevated. According to the CME FedWatch Tool as well as fed funds futures, the market was expecting only three cuts in 2025, so making sense of a suddenly cratering stock market over one 25-basis-point cut seems ridiculous.   The S&P 500 fell almost 3% on Wednesday, the Nasdaq and Nasdaq 100 dropped 3.6%, and the S&P 400 and S&P 600 declined about 4%. NYSE breadth was brutal at -2,719, logging the worst day since June 2022 (during the bear market). NYSE up volume/total volume was 15% and NYSE advances/issues chimed in at a brutal 7%.   The 5/13 exponential moving average (EMA) crossover turned bearish, trendline support off the lows since September and the 50-day average was busted, and the 21-day rate-of-change and the daily Vortex indicator turned bearish. On a weekly basis, the middle Bollinger Band (BB) is at 5,775; that needs to hold, or this could unravel rather quickly as the lower BB is down at 5,400. The 26-week EMA is at 5,720 and the 40-week EMA is at 5,555. Key chart support from the last breakout is 5,670.

The worries, according to interviews with workers, ex-employees, a former board member and analysts, come ahead of a March deadline for Ecopetrol to renew - or end - its joint oil venture with Occidental Petroleum in Texas.  Petro halted a separate $3.6-billion deal with Occidental to buy 30% of shale producer CrownRock in August, because of his opposition to fracking and fears about the company taking on more debt, according to two former Ecopetrol board members who resigned over the decision.
