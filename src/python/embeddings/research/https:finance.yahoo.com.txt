As 2025 approaches, investors are focusing on the Fed\'s view of the neutral interest rate in the post-pandemic economy. The Wall Street Journal\'s Chief Economics Correspondent, Nick Timiraos, joins Market Domination to explore the concept of the Fed\'s neutral rate. Timiraos explains that a decade ago, the Fed rarely discussed neutral rate outlooks publicly. This changed during Fed Chair Janet Yellen\'s term, when she began discussing how rates would remain lower for longer due to a declining neutral rate. Timiraos defines the neutral rate as "what the right interest rate would be to ... have low and stable inflation with maximum employment. What is the interest rate that best gets you there and keeps you there when there aren\'t shocks hitting the economy," though he describes this as "a nirvana-like scenario." This neutral rate helps the Fed determine whether they should be "stepping on the gas pedal or stepping on the breaks" regarding monetary policy. However, Timiraos notes that the upcoming Trump administration\'s policies are "adding more uncertainty to this" current calculation.

More News      Dow Rebounding After Fed Scare Triggers Huge Selloff. Index on 10-Day Losing Streak. U.S. stocks looked set to pare back some of their losses on Thursday after Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell put a lump of coal in markets’ Christmas stocking by signaling that sticky inflation means investors shouldn’t expect deep rate cuts next year.  Futures tracking the Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 321 points, or 0.8%.  All three indexes had plummeted on Wednesday, with Powell’s hawkish presser sinking the Dow by 1,100 points to lock in its longest losing streak in half a century.   Barrons.com • 22 hours ago   ^DJI   +0.04%   ^GSPC   -0.09%       Morning Bid: Markets fear Fed floor at 4%, dollar booms Although the Federal Reserve\'s "hawkish cut" on Thursday had been broadly expected, markets now fear 4% policy rates will be the floor for the coming year at least - and no further easing until midyear or later.  The picture painted by the Fed removes monetary easing as tailwind from the stock market for months and has seen the dollar rocket to its highest in more than two years - bowling over emerging, developed and crypto currencies alike.  Lifting their median inflation forecast for next year by 0.3 percentage point to 2.5% but only nudging the GDP growth up a tenth to 2.1%, Fed policymakers also raised their policy rate forecasts for the next two years by half a point to 3.9% and 3.4% respectively.

Business Insider • 16 hours ago      Daily Spotlight: Fed\'s Favorite Inflation Indicator Out Today The Federal Reserve\'s favorite inflation indicator, the PCE Price Index, will be released by the BEA this morning. The index differs from the better-known Consumer Price Index because its composition is changed more frequently and is thus quicker to reflect real-time pricing fluctuations. In the most recent report, through October, PCE inflation was reported at 2.3% year over year (by comparison, the latest CPI report, through November, had inflation at 2.7%). Core PCE, which removes volatile food and energy prices, rose at a rate of 2.8% in the latest month. Our PCE forecasts call for 2.5% for the headline number and for 2.9% for the core reading, as lingering inflation in certain services remains a challenge. Overall, inflation in this cycle peaked in summer 2022 and has been on a fairly consistent downward trek since that time. We track 20 inflation measures on a monthly basis. On average, they are indicating that prices are rising at a 2.4% rate year over year, up from 2.3% a month ago. We note the numbers are volatile and are distorted somewhat by swings within the Producer Price Inflation report. Focusing on core inflation --- which we obtain by averaging Core CPI, market-based PCE Ex-Food & Energy (from the GDP report), the five-year forward inflation expectation rate, the 10-year TIPs Break-even Interest Rate, and the Fed\'s favorite core PCE Price Index -- our reading is 2.4%, essentially flat month over month. Looking down the road, investors are expecting that the Federal Reserve\'s series of rate hikes ultimately will tame inflation, with the five-year forward expectation rate at 2.25%.
