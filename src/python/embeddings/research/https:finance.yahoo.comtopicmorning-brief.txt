Yahoo Finance • 6 days ago   META      SHOP         The Fed can\'t just be \'data dependent\' in 2025 — it needs to be \'policy dependent\' Fed Chair Jay Powell has taken great pains to avoid politics.

Yahoo Finance • 25 days ago   WMT      SWK           Bitcoin isn’t \'frothy\' even with this rally — the \'Kimchi premium\' helps explain why Bitcoin may be at a record high, recapturing public attention as it crests six figures.
