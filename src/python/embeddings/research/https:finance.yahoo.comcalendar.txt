Yahoo Finance • 2 minutes ago       High prices impinging on India\'s growth, central bank minutes show High prices are the cause for demand slowdown in India, and aligning inflation to the central bank\'s 4% target is key to ensuring sustained economic growth, members of the rate-setting panel said in the minutes of the December meeting.  "The policy priority at this critical juncture has to be on restoring the inflation growth balance," Reserve Bank of India Governor Shaktikanta Das said in the minutes of his last monetary policy committee (MPC) meeting released on Friday.  Lower inflation will enhance households\' disposable income and increase their purchasing power, and this approach would support consumption and investment demand, Das said.
