Natural gas demand from US LNG export plants heads for first decline in 8 years Demand for U.S. natural gas to produce liquefied natural gas (LNG) for export this year is headed for its first decline since the country started exporting the super-chilled fuel from the lower 48 states eight years ago.  Natural gas prices have remained relatively high in Europe as the expected U.S. growth in output in 2024 has not materialized and the continent is bracing for a new gas price shock as colder winter weather depletes stocks.  Natural gas drillers have profited from robust demand from LNG export plants especially since sanctions on Russian gas boosted European demand for U.S. LNG.  Reuters • 1 hour ago      Turmoil at Colombia\'s Ecopetrol raises profit fears ahead of US investment decision Alleged interference by Colombian President Gustavo Petro in majority state-owned Ecopetrol and purges of hundreds of staff to make way for pro-government replacements are fueling fears about the energy company\'s future profits and contributions to the economy.  The worries, according to interviews with workers, ex-employees, a former board member and analysts, come ahead of a March deadline for Ecopetrol to renew - or end - its joint oil venture with Occidental Petroleum in Texas.  Petro halted a separate $3.6-billion deal with Occidental to buy 30% of shale producer CrownRock in August, because of his opposition to fracking and fears about the company taking on more debt, according to two former Ecopetrol board members who resigned over the decision.

Already sideswiped by what was seen as a \'hawkish cut\' in Federal Reserve interest rates on Wednesday, where the central bank lifted both its 2025 policy rate and inflation projections, the S&P 500 was in the red again late Thursday and futures were down almost 1% before Friday\'s bell.  A spending bill backed by Donald Trump failed in the U.S. House of Representatives late Thursday as dozens of Republicans defied the President-elect, leaving Congress with no clear plan to avert a fast-approaching government shutdown that could disrupt Christmas travel.

Trump said that the European Union may face tariffs if the bloc does not cut its growing deficit with the United States by making large oil and gas trades with the world\'s largest economy.   Reuters • 1 hour ago     Novo Nordisk shares plunge after CagriSema obesity drug trial disappoints Novo Nordisk said on Friday its experimental next-generation obesity drug CagriSema helped patients cut their weight by 22.7% in a late-stage trial, below the 25% it had expected, wiping as much as $125 billion off its market value.  The lower-than-expected weight loss from the drug candidate deals a blow to the Danish company\'s ambitions for a successor to its popular Wegovy that is more powerful than Eli Lilly\'s rival Zepbound, also known as Mounjaro.  Investors and analysts had eagerly awaited this data as a test of Novo\'s case that it has a strong pipeline of drugs to follow Wegovy in the fiercely competitive anti-obesity market.

Chinese state-owned refiner Sinopec said in its annual energy outlook released on Thursday that China\'s crude imports could peak as soon as 2025 and the country\'s oil consumption would peak by 2027 as diesel and gasoline demand weaken.  "Benchmark crude prices are in a prolonged consolidation phase as the market heads towards the year-end weighed by uncertainty in oil demand growth," said Emril Jamil, senior research specialist at LSEG.   Reuters • 10 hours ago     U.S. crude exports to Europe expected to fall in Jan as shipping economics weaken U.S. crude oil exports to northwest Europe are likely to slip early next year after hitting a record high in November, as the arbitrage for transatlantic shipments has slammed shut and freight rates have climbed, analysts said this week.  The spread between U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude and Brent futures has narrowed to a discount of around $3.40 per barrel over the last two sessions, the smallest closing spread since October 2023.  A narrower spread makes it less economic to ship barrels from the U.S. across the Atlantic.

The picture painted by the Fed removes monetary easing as tailwind from the stock market for months and has seen the dollar rocket to its highest in more than two years - bowling over emerging, developed and crypto currencies alike.  Lifting their median inflation forecast for next year by 0.3 percentage point to 2.5% but only nudging the GDP growth up a tenth to 2.1%, Fed policymakers also raised their policy rate forecasts for the next two years by half a point to 3.9% and 3.4% respectively.
