US equity funds saw biggest net outflows in 15 years ahead of Fed decision Investors pulled a net $50.2 billion from U.S. equity funds in the week ending Dec. 18, according to LSEG Lipper data, the biggest net outflow since Sept. as they cashed in profits from a market rally ahead of the Fed policy decision. The Fed cut rates as expected on Wednesday but projected fewer-than-expected interest rate cuts and higher inflation next year, while Chair Jerome Powell explicitly referred a need for caution, prompting a sell-off in equity markets.  Reuters • 6 minutes ago      Trump was poised to inherit a strong economy. Then things got rocky and he added to the uncertainty The smooth economy that Donald Trump was poised to inherit suddenly looks a bit rockier — with critics saying the president-elect is contributing to the uncertainty.  The Federal Reserve now sees inflation as staying stubbornly elevated as it has become cautious about further interest rate cuts planned for next year.  On Wednesday, Trump blew up a bipartisan budget deal, which means the government could shut down after midnight Saturday.

Dozens of Republicans defied President-elect Donald Trump\'s spending bill, leaving Congress with no clear plan before government funding expires at midnight.  Trump\'s plans on tariffs, tax cuts and deregulation were among the factors that pushed the Federal Reserve to raise its 2025 forecast for inflation and halve the central bank\'s projections of rate cuts that slammed Wall Street on Wednesday.

The core consumer price index (CPI) in Tokyo, a leading indicator of nationwide price trends, was expected to have sped up to 2.5% year-on-year in December from 2.2% in November, the median forecast of 17 economists showed.  "With the end of the subsidies for electricity and city gas provided by the government, energy prices are expected to rise, pushing up the core CPI significantly," said analysts at SMBC Nikko Securities.

Chinese state-owned refiner Sinopec said in its annual energy outlook released on Thursday that China\'s crude imports could peak as soon as 2025 and the country\'s oil consumption would peak by 2027 as diesel and gasoline demand weaken.  "Benchmark crude prices are in a prolonged consolidation phase as the market heads towards the year-end weighed by uncertainty in oil demand growth," said Emril Jamil, senior research specialist at LSEG.

FreightWaves • 17 hours ago       More hawkish Fed policy committee may increase dissent in 2025 A slightly more hawkish set of Federal Reserve regional bank presidents will become voters on the U.S. central bank\'s rate-setting panel in 2025, raising the chance that any further interest rate cuts next year could spur more dissents like the one seen on Wednesday from the head of the Cleveland Fed.  Fed Chair Jerome Powell has already signaled a pause in the rate cuts in January, saying on Wednesday that policymakers will move cautiously, with further reductions in borrowing costs contingent on seeing more progress in lowering inflation.  All 12 regional Fed presidents discuss and debate monetary policy at each of the U.S. central bank\'s eight annual meetings, and many have said their status as voter or non-voter has no bearing on their sway around the policy-setting table.

The regional report from the Philly Fed suggests the factory sector, accounting for just over 10% of the economy, is continuing to struggle finding its footing in the wake of the Federal Reserve\'s interest rate hikes in 2022 and 2023.  While the Fed has shifted to rate cuts in the last half of this year, it is not expected to ease that much further from here and market-based measures of borrowing costs remain notably higher than they were in early 2022 and continue to exert pressure on investment.   Reuters • 22 hours ago      US third-quarter economic growth revised higher The U.S. economy grew faster than previously estimated in the third quarter, driven by robust consumer spending.  Gross domestic product increased at an upwardly revised 3.1% annualized rate, the Commerce Department\'s Bureau of Economic Analysis said in its third estimate of third-quarter GDP on Thursday.  The revision reflected upgrades to consumer spending and export growth, which offset a downward revision to private inventory investment and upward revision to imports.

Jobless claim applications declined by 22,000 to 220,000 for the week of Dec. 14, the Labor Department reported Thursday.  Continuing claims, the total number of Americans collecting jobless benefits, fell by 5,000 to 1.87 million for the week of Dec. 7.   Associated Press Finance • 22 hours ago         US economy eyes strong finish ahead of heightened policy uncertainty in 2025 WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The number of Americans filing new applications for jobless benefits fell more than expected last week, almost reversing the prior two weeks\' increases and suggesting that a gradual labor market slowdown remained in place.  Other data on Thursday showed the economy grew faster than previously estimated in the third quarter, driven by robust consumer spending.  The upbeat reports came a day after the Federal Reserve delivered a third consecutive interest rate cut, but projected only two rate reductions in 2025, citing the economy\'s continued resilience and still-elevated inflation.   Reuters • 22 hours ago      U.S. economy grows at 3.1% pace in third quarter, an upgrade from previous estimate The American economy grew at a healthy 3.1% annual clip from July through September, propelled by vigorous consumer spending and an uptick in exports, the government said in an upgrade to its previous estimate.  Third-quarter growth in U.S. gross domestic product — the economy\'s output of goods and services — accelerated from the April-July rate of 3% and continued to look sturdy despite high interest rates, the Commerce Department said Thursday.  Consumer spending, which accounts for about two-thirds of U.S. economic activity, expanded at a 3.7% pace, fastest since the first quarter of 2023 and an uptick from Commerce’s previous third-quarter estimate of 3.5%.

Associated Press Finance • 23 hours ago       Big year of central bank easing wraps up with dovish BoE, Fed caution The Bank of England wrapped up a big year of central bank rate cuts by keeping rates steady on Thursday, a day after the Federal Reserve eased policy but suggested it would be more cautious in 2025.  The Swiss National Bank, which has been at the forefront of monetary easing, cut rates by an unexpectedly large 50 basis points (bps) to 0.5% last week, the lowest since November 2022 and the bank\'s biggest reduction in almost a decade.  It indicated further easing would be gradual after annual inflation accelerated to 2%, but with Canada\'s weak economy threatened by U.S. President-elect Donald Trump\'s proposed tariffs, markets placed 50% odds on a 25-bps cut next month.

Consumers, wary of higher grocery prices, have turned to cheaper private label brands, hurting sales at packaged food companies including Conagra, Campbell\'s Co, Kraft Heinz and JM Smucker.  Conagra, which typically caters to more budget-strapped customers, said volumes improved in the snacking and staples categories such as microwave popcorn, and frozen vegetables on the back of promotions, thought it remains cautious on deep discounting.

The picture painted by the Fed removes monetary easing as tailwind from the stock market for months and has seen the dollar rocket to its highest in more than two years - bowling over emerging, developed and crypto currencies alike.  Lifting their median inflation forecast for next year by 0.3 percentage point to 2.5% but only nudging the GDP growth up a tenth to 2.1%, Fed policymakers also raised their policy rate forecasts for the next two years by half a point to 3.9% and 3.4% respectively.

Economic data was in sync with the Fed\'s view, with weekly initial jobless claims falling more than expected while gross domestic product for the third quarter was revised to show a 3.1% increase from the previously reported 2.8% pace.  "It clearly sent a message that rates weren\'t going to keep going down if inflation didn\'t continue its decline, and we\'ve seen inflation tick up a bit here, and that\'s a concern to the Fed," said Tim Ghriskey, senior portfolio strategist at Ingalls & Snyder in New York.

The Fed\'s tacit acknowledgement of the inflationary risks likely to come from incoming president Donald Trump\'s immigration and trade policies unnerved investors.  U.S. Treasury yields rose, sending the dollar to its highest in two years against six major rivals.

Luigi Mangione was held without bail following a Manhattan federal court appearance, capping a whirlwind day that began in Pennsylvania, where he was arrested last week in the Dec. 4 attack on Brian Thompson.  The 26-year-old Ivy League graduate had been expected to be arraigned Thursday on a state murder indictment in a killing that at once rattled the business community and galvanized some health insurance critics, but the federal charges preempted that appearance.   Associated Press Finance • yesterday   UNH          Analysis-US stocks face headwind from rising yields after Fed signals fewer rate cuts NEW YORK (Reuters) -The rally in U.S. stocks is encountering a fresh hurdle -- a potentially problematic rise in Treasury yields as the Federal Reserve signals fewer interest rate cuts for 2025.  The central bank\'s rate outlook on Wednesday included only two cuts in the coming year, rather than the four previously penciled in, catching investors off guard, and sending stocks tumbling while driving up yields and the dollar.  That overshadowed the Fed\'s widely expected decision to reduce its benchmark rate for a third straight meeting.

The U.S. central bank cut interest rates on Wednesday, as expected, but Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said more reductions in borrowing costs now hinged on further progress in lowering stubbornly high inflation.  U.S. central bankers now project they will make just two quarter-percentage-point rate reductions next year, half a percentage point less than anticipated in September, with higher projections of inflation for the first year of the new Donald Trump administration.
