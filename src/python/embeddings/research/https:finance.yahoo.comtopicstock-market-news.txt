The benchmark S&P 500 is up over 23% year-to-date, even with a recent speed bump, and is on pace for its second straight year of gains exceeding 20%, lifted by megacap tech stocks and excitement over the business potential of artificial intelligence.

The consensus is that a sector-wide move in that direction is necessary, to reverse the effects of previous decades when much of the US manufacturing plant was moved abroad, to Mexico or East Asia. While reshoring remains more of a policy conversation than a full-scale movement, it has nonetheless influenced recent federal elections.

Already sideswiped by what was seen as a \'hawkish cut\' in Federal Reserve interest rates on Wednesday, where the central bank lifted both its 2025 policy rate and inflation projections, the S&P 500 was in the red again late Thursday and futures were down almost 1% before Friday\'s bell.

Confectionery prices, from candy bars to hot chocolate, are heavily influenced by futures contracts for cocoa beans.  In the middle of last year, hedge funds - a class of investors that use privately pooled money to make speculative bets - started pulling back from trading cocoa futures because price swings in the market were raising their cost of trading and making it harder to make profits.
